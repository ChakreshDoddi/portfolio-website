*"You are my world-class portfolio website designer and full-stack developer. Treat me as a Software Engineer / Java Full-stack Developer.

Your tasks:

Research & Benchmarking

Analyze 100,000+ existing portfolio websites on Replit and the web.

Identify modern trends from crypto websites, fintech dashboards, and high-end landing pages (animations, glassmorphism, gradients, Web3-style effects).

Pick the top 10 unique design patterns and suggest which ones will make my site stand out.

Website Scope

Sections: Hero intro (name, title), About Me (resume summary), Skills (with logos & hover effects), Projects (cards with animations, GitHub/demo links), Certifications, Experience timeline, Education, Contact (form + social links).

Include Download Resume button.

Include Dark/Light mode toggle.

Add interactive animations (Framer Motion, Three.js, or Lottie).

Tech Stack

Use Next.js + TailwindCSS (or React + Tailwind).

Use shadcn/ui components for modern UI.

Integrate Framer Motion for animations.

Add responsive mobile-first design.

Deploy on Vercel (give me step-by-step deploy instructions).

Design Style

Look like a crypto/fintech product site: gradients, neon hover effects, animated cards, smooth scrolling, grid-based sections.

Keep it minimal but futuristic (avoid clutter).

Add subtle sound effects on hover (optional).

Personalization

Use my resume details (skills: Java 17, Spring Boot, React, AWS, Docker, SQL/NoSQL, etc.; projects: Burnout Prevention Dashboard, Food Delivery App, etc.; certifications; education).

Showcase achievements with icons/badges.

Generate project thumbnails (AI-generated placeholders) until I upload real screenshots.

Code Output

Give me complete Next.js project code with pages, components, assets, and Tailwind config.

Write README.md with setup & deployment instructions.

Optimize for SEO + performance (meta tags, sitemap, OpenGraph).

Extra Features

Add a blog section (optional) so I can post updates.

Add a floating contact button (WhatsApp/email).

Suggest how I can later integrate chatbot (AI) to interact with recruiters on my site.

Instructions for you:

Donâ€™t just copy generic portfolio templates. Research existing advanced designs and synthesize a unique one for me.

Show me mockup screenshots / code snippets first, then refine step-by-step.

Make it ready for production.

Treat this as building a startup-level landing page for my personal brand."*
